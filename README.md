# Cafe Project

This project was completed as part of the Fundamentals of Programming module

In this project, I developed a Java program that simulated a till system for a Café. 

Users could select an item they wanted to buy, select to pay with either cash or card and, if cash was used, enter the amount they gave so change could be calculated. 

This app was developed to be as user friendly as possible for café owners, who could edit a .txt items file to update or add products and product prices. 

Additionally, all transactions with transaction details would be written to a transactions file for easy access. 

This program also featured advanced error handling, with custom error classes handling user input and incorrect program logic.
